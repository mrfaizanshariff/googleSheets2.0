First we'll create the basic skeleton of the Google Sheets application
it has a:
-Nav bar
-cut,copy actions bar
-formula bar
-actual cells
-sheets bar
Once we've created the skeleton its time to add content in it
First the nav bar.
Then Add icons in the prop actions bar from material icons
Then we need to add a drop down to select the font and font size
